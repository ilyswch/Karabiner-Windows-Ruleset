A ruleset for [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org) to use Windows keyboard shortcuts on macOS.

This configuration helped me a lot when I switched from Windows to macOS and can be especially helpful for Windows keyboards used with macOS.

## Installation
To import the rules, simply paste the link into a web browser.
